# Project example using sky130_as_sc_hs

This is an example project using the [sky130_as_sc_hs](https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/sky130_as_sc_hs) standard cell library.

Run `make setup` as usual then follow the installation instructions of the cell library (minus the config changes).
You can now run `make wrapped_tholin_riscv` followed by `make user_project_wrapper` as normal.

The RTL is taken from [this](https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/gfmpw1-multi) OpenMPW submission.
